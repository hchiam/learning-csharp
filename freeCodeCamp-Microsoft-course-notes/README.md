# my notes on freeCodeCamp / Microsoft foundational course on C #

- Visual Studio Code (vscode)
- vscode extension "C# Dev Kit"
- vscode extension "IntelliCode for C# Dev Kit" (for AI assistance, maybe if you don't already have AI assistance)
- `dotnet --version` to confirm .NET SDK is installed -> .NET SDK lets you run/debug C# apps
- `dotnet new console -o ./CsharpProjects/TestProject` creates a new console app in `./CsharpProjects/TestProject`
  - `cd CsharpProjects/TestProject/`
- `dotnet build` to compile the app
- `dotnet run` to run the app
